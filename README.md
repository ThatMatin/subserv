Subscription service
The task is to build a service including the features of the following stories.
You can choose the programing language you want, for us it is important to see how you work and what approaches you have. The data can be
mocked, you can use any kind of database you want to use.
Please use a git repository to keep track on your changes and share the link with us when you have everything finished.
We are expecting an API that matches the following user behaviours. The user API is called by our client e.g. OTT Apps or Web platform (that you
donâ€™t have to build).
Please create a documentation that we can see all created API endpoints and how we are able to use them. Also share a README.md with us,
how we can test your service..
